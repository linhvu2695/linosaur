Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT">AutoGPT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer">GPT-Engineer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi">BabyAGI</a>, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.

# Agent System Overview
In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:
## Planning
* Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.
* Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.

## Memory
* Short-term memory: consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.
* Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.

## Tool use
The agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.

*Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.*

# Component One: Planning
A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.

## Task Decomposition
**Chain of thought** (CoT; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903">Wei et al. 2022</a>) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.

**Tree of Thoughts** (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601">Yao et al. 2023</a>) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.

## Self-Reflection
Self-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.

### ReAct: Reasoning and Acting
ReAct(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629">Yao et al. 2023</a>) integrates reasoning by combining iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.
<img src="https://cuicaihao.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-4.png">

Speciﬁcally, from the paper, the authors use a combination of thoughts that decompose questions (“I need to search x, ﬁnd y, then ﬁnd z”), extract information from Wikipedia observations (“x was started in 1844”, “The paragraph does not tell x”), perform commonsense (“x is not y, so z must instead be…”) or arithmetic reasoning (“1844 < 1989”), guide search reformulation (“maybe I can search/lookup x instead”), and synthesize the ﬁnal answer (“…so the answer is x”).

*Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).*
In both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the `Act`-only baseline where `Thought`: … step is removed.

### DSP: Directional Stimulus Prompting
Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11520">Z. Li 2023</a>), is a novel framework for guiding black-box large language models (LLMs) toward specific desired outputs.  Instead of directly adjusting LLMs, this method employs a *small tunable policy model* to generate an **auxiliary directional stimulus** (hints) prompt for each input instance.

# Component Two: Memory
Imitating that of the human brain, an agent will need two types of memory to build up its acknowledgement about the surrounding world
* **Short-term memory**: defined as the current state or current context. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer. An agent needs to know what is going on in the application, what date it is, who it is talking to, via what communication channel and what language, how the conversation has been going on... All of this information are compressed into the prompt, so the most impact on this short-term memory quality would be the way compose the prompt, or our **prompt engineering**
<img src="https://cuicaihao.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-9.png">

* **Long-term memory**: as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval. The most symbolic solution for this is the infamous RAG system

# Component Three: Tools
Tool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.

**MRKL** (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445">Karpas et al. 2022</a>), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API). Both **TALM** (Tool Augmented Language Models; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12255">Parisi et al. 2022</a>) and **Toolformer** (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761">Schick et al. 2023</a>) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs.

ChatGPT <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins">Plugins</a> and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling">OpenAI API function calling</a> are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).

**HuggingGPT** (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580">Shen et al. 2023</a>) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.

*Illustration of how HuggingGPT works.*

**API-Bank** (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08244">Li et al. 2023</a>) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.

# Summary
An agent that can perform mundane to complex tasks for you is an attractive concept. An armies of agent can even replace departments of staff. Customer support combines familiar chatbot interfaces with enhanced capabilities through tool integration. Meanwhile, the software development space has shown remarkable potential for LLM features, with capabilities evolving from code completion to autonomous problem-solving. 

However, success in the LLM space isn't about building the most sophisticated system. It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short.
